\section{Real Heat Engines}
In the previous lecture, we have learned the theoretical limit of heat engines.
It is useful to know the upper limit when we design the engine.
However, one might also ask how it work in reality.
Can we follow the Carnot cycle in practice?

Now, let's discuss a few of engines used in real world.

Recall what we learned about P-V diagram in compression work, we can trivially derived the efficiency as a function of $V$
\begin{equation}
PV^{\gamma} = \text{const} ~~~~\rightarrow~~~~~~ e = 1-(\frac{V_2}{V_1})^{\gamma-1} 
                                                   = 1-\frac{T_1}{T_2} 
                                                   = 1-\frac{T_3}{T_4}~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \text{(Otto cycle)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
PV = \text{const} ~~~~\rightarrow~~~~~~ e = 1-\frac{V_2}{V_1}  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \text{(Diesel cycle)}
\end{equation}

\section{Steam Engines and Real Refrigerators}
A very different type of engine is the steam Engine, in which the liquid water/steam were used as the work substance.
It works as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
\item water is pumper to high pressure at nearly constant volume;
\item water flows into a boiler at constant pressure condition, then becomes steam;
\item steam hit the turbine, where it expands adiabatically, cools, ends up at the original pressure;
\item the fluid is cooled further to become water.
\end{enumerate}

On the other hand, refrigerator works as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
\item gas is compressed to adiabatically;
\item gives up heat and become liquids at constant pressure;
\item passes through a Throttle valve to 
\item absorbs heat and turns back to a gas in the evaporator
\end{enumerate}
